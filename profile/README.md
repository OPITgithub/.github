OPIT GitHub Repository Guidelines

Welcome to **OPITgithub**! This space is designed to provide students with access to course materials, projects, and assignments while ensuring a secure and collaborative environment. Please review the following policy updates regarding repository access, forking permissions, and visibility settings.

**Repository Access and Permissions**

To enhance both the security and educational experience on this platform, we have updated our policy for how students access and interact with repositories.

**1. Base Permissions**
- **Previous Setting**: Students had base-level "**Read**" permissions, which allowed them to see the content of all repositories.
- **New Setting**: Students will now have the base permission set to "**No Permission**", meaning they will not automatically have access to any repositories unless explicitly granted.

**2. Visibility of Course Repositories**
- **Previous Setting**: Course repositories were set to "**Private**", restricting their visibility.
- **New Setting**: Course repositories will now be set to "**Internal**". This means that all students within OPIT (and any relevant institution members) will have access to view and interact with these repositories. However, external parties will not have access.
  - **Internal** repositories will continue to be visible to students, allowing them to view course content, assignments, and other educational materials as needed.

**3. Forking and Repository Permissions**
- **Forked Repositories**: When students fork course repositories for their own assignments or projects, the forked repositories will automatically be set to "**Private**".
  - **Private Forks**: With this new setting, **private forks will no longer be visible** to other students. This ensures that individual student work remains confidential and cannot be viewed by peers.
  - **Instructor Access**: Instructors and teaching assistants will still have access to students' private forks for grading and feedback purposes.

**4. Use of institutional OPIT's Accounts**

To maintain consistency and ensure smooth access to course materials and assignments, we **strongly recommend that all students use their institutional email account (@students.opit.com)** when forking or interacting with course repositories. Using your institutional account ensures that:
- You are properly recognized within the OPIT network, allowing you to automatically inherit the correct permissions for accessing internal repositories.

**Summary of Changes**
- Base permission for all students is now "**No Permission**". Students will not have automatic access to repositories unless explicitly granted.
- Course repositories are now set as "**Internal**", ensuring that all students can still view relevant materials, but external users cannot.
- **Private forks** of course repositories will no longer be visible to other students, protecting the integrity and privacy of individual student work.
- **Students are encouraged to use their institutional accounts (@students.opit.com)** to ensure seamless access and proper tracking of their academic work.

**FAQs**

**Q1: What does "No Permission" mean for my access?**

"No Permission" means that you will not automatically see all repositories upon logging in. You will only have access to repositories that are made "Internal" or where specific permissions have been granted to you.

**Q2: What is the difference between "Internal" and "Private"?**

"Internal" repositories can be accessed by all members of OPIT or its affiliated institutions, but they are not publicly visible. "Private" repositories are only visible to the repository owner and specifically designated users (e.g., instructors).

**Q3: Why can't I see my classmates' forks anymore?**

To protect student privacy and prevent any unauthorized access to individual work, private forks will no longer be visible to other students. Only instructors and authorized personnel will have access to them.

**Q4: How do I know if I have access to a course repository?**

If the course repository is set as "Internal", you will have access automatically if you're part of the OPIT network. If you have any issues, please contact your instructor or system administrator.

**Q5: Why should I use my institutional (@students.opit.com) account?**

Using your institutional account ensures that you are correctly identified within the OPIT network and will automatically receive access to relevant course repositories. It also allows for better tracking of your work by instructors.

**Support**

For any issues or questions related to repository access, permissions, forking, or updating your account information, please contact the the OPIT team via the OPIT Hub course on Canvas.

By following these updated policies, we aim to maintain a secure, fair, and effective learning environment for all students and instructors at OPIT. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!
